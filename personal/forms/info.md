By default when submitting forms the page refreshes thus we need to handle it in some way.
using formData object in JS.

EVENTS ON FORM:

Submit Event: Triggered when the form is submitted.

Change Event: Occurs when the value of an input element changes.

Input Event: Fires whenever the user types into an input field2.

FormData Event: The formdata event occurs after a form's data is constructed upon submission. This event allows developers to modify the data before it is sent to the server.
